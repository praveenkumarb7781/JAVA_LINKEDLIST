What is a Linked List?
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node, allowing for dynamic memory allocation.

Types of Linked Lists

Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next one, forming a chain.
Example: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null

Doubly Linked List: Nodes point to both the next and the previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.
Example: null <- 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 -> null

Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, creating a loop.
Example: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 (back to start)

Key Takeaways:
Linked Lists allow dynamic memory management, unlike arrays. Each type has its own advantages depending on the application.
